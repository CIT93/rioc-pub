                <p>In the `createTableRow` function, `document.createElement('tr')` is used. How is this different from just writing a `` tag directly in your HTML file?</p>

                    <li><strong>If the answer is correct</strong>, respond with "Exactly! Writing `` in HTML creates a static row that's always there. `document.createElement()` allows us to dynamically create new rows with JavaScript based on our data, which is essential for displaying a list of entries."</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is partially correct</strong>, respond with "You're on the right track&mdash;it's about when it's created. What does it mean for an element to be 'dynamic'? What data are we using to create these rows?"</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is incorrect or the user is unsure,</strong> provide "Think of it like this: writing in the HTML file is like printing a form that's permanent. `document.createElement()` is like having a stamp that lets us add a new row to the page whenever we need to, based on the data in our array."</li>

                    <li><strong>If the answer is correct</strong>, respond with "Perfect! It clears out all the old rows before adding the new ones. Without it, every time you submitted a new form, the entire list of entries would be added to the table again, creating many duplicates."</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is partially correct</strong>, respond with "You're right, it's about cleaning up. What specific problem does it prevent when the `renderTable` function is called more than once?"</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is incorrect or the user is unsure,</strong> provide "Imagine the table is a whiteboard. Before you write the updated list, you have to erase what was there before. `innerHTML = ''` is the eraser that ensures we start with a clean slate each time we render the table."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is correct</strong>, respond with "That's a key concept in modern JavaScript! The `.sort()` method modifies the array directly. By creating a copy, we ensure that we don't change the original order of the `carbonFootprintEntries` array, which can prevent unexpected bugs. This is called a non-destructive operation."</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is partially correct</strong>, respond with "You're right that it's a safety measure. What does the `.sort()` method do to the array it's called on? Does it return a new sorted array or change the original one?"</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is incorrect or the user is unsure,</strong> provide "The `.sort()` method actually rearranges the original array it's called on. By making a copy with `[...entries]`, we sort the copy and leave the original `carbonFootprintEntries` array in its original insertion order, which is safer."</li>

                <p>Look at the `sort` function: `(a, b) =&gt; new Date(b.timestamp) - new Date(a.timestamp)`. How does subtracting date `a` from date `b` result in a descending (newest first) sort order?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is correct</strong>, respond with "Excellent explanation! When `b` is a more recent date, `b - a` results in a positive number, telling `.sort()` that `b` should come before `a`. If `a` were more recent, the result would be negative, correctly placing `a` first. This is how the compare function works."</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is partially correct</strong>, respond with "You're on the right track about it comparing the two dates. What kind of value (positive, negative, or zero) does the compare function need to return to tell `.sort()` to place `b` before `a`?"</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is incorrect or the user is unsure,</strong> provide "The `.sort()` method relies on the return value: if it's positive, `b` is sorted before `a`. A newer date is a larger number, so `newest - oldest` gives a positive number, achieving the correct descending order."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is correct</strong>, respond with "That's it! It makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and reusable. The `createTableRow` function's template literal isn't cluttered with complex logic, and if we need to format a date elsewhere, we can just call the helper function again."</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is partially correct</strong>, respond with "You're right that it makes the main function cleaner. What other benefit does it provide if we needed to format radio button values in another part of our application?"</li>
                    <li><strong>If the answer is incorrect or the user is unsure,</strong> provide "This follows a programming principle called DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
